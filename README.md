Prerequisites: 
•	D<h1>ownload</h1> and install the latest version of node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
•	Install React.js using node.js with command prompt (npm install -g create-react-app)
•	Install jquery using node.js with command prompt (npm install jquery --save)

This project uses React.js to fetch your starred GitHub repos with the API: https://api.github.com/users/axiomaticdesign/starred and displays them. The project runs by first installing node.js. Next, you’ll need to install React.js by opening the command prompt and typing in “npm install -g create-react-app” on the project’s file location. It may take some time for React.js to install (approx. 3mins). To run the program you’re going to have to type in “npm start” to start the server. After doing this you should install jquery by typing “npm install jquery –save” and then you’ll be able to run the program no problem.

I did not use the style library SCSS or Styled Components during the development of this challenge although I did read that it was recommended or mentioned in the description.
